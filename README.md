## Featured projects

### 1. **Hotel Cancellations Analytics (Python, scikit-learn, Pandas)**

Predicted whether hotel guests would cancel their bookings using a dataset of 119 K reservations from two Portuguese hotels.  

- Cleaned and merged multi-source booking data, handling bias by dropping nationality to ensure fairness.  
- Analysed correlations to identify top five drivers of cancellations (lead time, prior cancellations, booking changes, parking requests, and special requests).  
- Trained and tuned four classification models — Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.  
- Achieved the best balance with Random Forest (F1 = 82%), while Decision Tree delivered the highest recall (78%), minimising missed cancellations.  
- Presented actionable insights for hotel revenue management and overbooking risk reduction.  

### 2. **Understanding Text through Word Embeddings (Python, Natural Language Processing)**

Predicted whether hotel guests would cancel their bookings using a dataset of 119 K reservations from two Portuguese hotels.  

- Implemented both Skip-Gram and CBOW architectures using Word2Vec to compare how each learns context.  
- Trained embeddings on a text corpus to visualise relationships between semantically related words.  
- Applied dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) to show how similar words cluster in vector space.  
- Analysed learned embeddings to explain how algorithms capture linguistic context for downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and topic detection.  
- Gained deeper understanding of data representation, vector similarity, and the logic behind modern language models.

## Future Projects

I’m currently exploring new ways to combine data analytics and business insight. Upcoming projects will focus on:  

- Power BI dashboards for business performance tracking and executive summaries  
- SQL-based analytics for query optimisation and process monitoring  
- Data storytelling case studies that translate insights into actionable recommendations  

These projects will extend my current portfolio into the applied business analytics space and showcase deeper visualisation and communication capabilities.
